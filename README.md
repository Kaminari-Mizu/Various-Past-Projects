This is code for a project I did where an ultrasonic sensor would collect data and send that through Microsoft Azure to an SQL database. 
I created it on the basis of ships using this and subsequently make use of the data
to avoid obstacles in the water in real time. The main components used were an ESP32, two ultrasonic sensors, a DC motor, and a servo motor.
In Azure I made use of the IoT Hub, SendToSQL and AnalyticStream resources.
The image included is the circuit diagram for this project made using Tinkercad. *Note that an ESP32 was used an not an Arduino
